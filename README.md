# mastermind
Mastermind game built with Javascript.

Instructions: 

- The goal of the game is to guess the combination of colors chosen by the computer. You have four different colors to choose from. 
- Each time a user completes a row of guesses, the column on the right displays hints for the next row of guesses. The hints are as follows: 

- Black dots: right color and right location
- Red dots: right color, wrong location
- Nothing: wrong color, wrong location. 

- If the user guesses the right combination before finishing all of his guesses, the game starts over. If the user doesn't guess the right combination after the 8 guesses, the computer combination is revealed.
